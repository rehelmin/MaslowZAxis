# MaslowZAxis
This project aims to add Z axis position control functionality to my homebrew MaslowCNC design. The software stack is designed to work on a [STM32F405 Adafruit Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382) board that uses the [DC+Stepper Feather wing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2927). It is intended to work with the HAL part of Machinekit.

Communication will be done through CANOpen using the CANOpenNode software stack.

!!!This codebase is very much not in a working state yet!!!
